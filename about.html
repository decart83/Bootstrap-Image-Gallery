                  <p>Brian Burroughs was born and raised in Michigan&#8217;s Upper Peninsula. From an early age it was obvious that he had a knack for drawing and a passion to be creative. He graduated from Northern Michigan University in 1998 where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree majoring in Art and Design.</p>
                  <p>Over the years, Burroughs has experimented in all different types of media including oil, acrylic, pastel, ink, and clay. However, what he is best known for are his graphite pencil drawings. Many of Burroughs&#8217; drawings have won awards in juried shows, including several &#8220;best of show&#8221; awards. His bizarre and original ideas, which have been dubbed &#8220;realistic surrealism&#8221;, are said to be both thought provoking and somewhat disturbing. It is this unique imagery that has become what Burroughs is best known for.</p>
                  <p>Brian Burroughs is continuing to create artwork on a daily basis. He finds increased inspiration from his family, music, other artists, and life in general. Brian&#8217;s most recent work is currently on display as part of the <a href="http://www.artprize.org/brian-burroughs/2012/empty-nest-syndrome" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.artprize.org']);">Artprize</a> competition in Grand Rapids. Check it out on the first floor of the <a href="http://www.thebob.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.thebob.com']);">B.O.B</a>. through October 7th.</p>
